This project contains data about a company's employee attrition and other factors/attributes about those employees.
This data also contains some minor inconsistencies in it and in this project, I have processed this data and visualized it in few plots.
We have used Gaussian Naive Bayesian Classifier to make a model that can predict an employee's possibility of Attrition.
Take a look at the project for more info and detailed understanding.
